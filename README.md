## Chapter 2: The Practice of Repeating Students

### Impact on Students with Special Needs

Repeating a grade is often seen as a solution to academic difficulties, giving students "another chance" to master the material. However, for students with special needs, this practice can have detrimental effects that extend beyond academic performance.

#### Emotional and Psychological Effects

**Loss of Self-Esteem**

When students with special needs are made to repeat a grade, it can severely impact their self-esteem. The implicit message is that they are not capable of progressing like their peers, which can lead to feelings of inadequacy and failure. These students often internalize the idea that they are not as capable, which can affect their motivation and engagement in learning.

**Increased Anxiety and Depression**

The stigma associated with being held back can lead to social isolation and increased anxiety. Students may feel embarrassed and out of place among younger classmates, leading to a sense of alienation. Over time, this can contribute to more serious mental health issues, including depression.

#### Academic and Social Consequences

**Delayed Academic Progress**

While the intention behind repeating a grade is to help students catch up academically, research shows that it often does not achieve this goal for students with special needs. These students typically require specialized support and tailored instructional strategies, rather than simply more time with the same material. As a result, they may continue to struggle academically, even after repeating a grade.

**Disrupted Social Development**

Socially, repeating a grade can be particularly challenging. Students with special needs might find it harder to form and maintain friendships with younger peers. The age difference can create barriers in social interactions, further isolating the student and impeding their social development.

#### Case Studies

**Case Study: Maria's Story**

Maria, a third-grader with dyslexia, was held back to repeat the grade after struggling with reading and writing. Despite the additional year, her academic performance did not improve significantly. The repeated curriculum did not address her specific learning needs, and she continued to face difficulties. Moreover, Maria felt increasingly isolated from her friends who had moved on to the fourth grade. Her self-confidence plummeted, and she became reluctant to participate in class activities.

**Case Study: Joshua's Experience**

Joshua, a student with ADHD, experienced similar challenges. His school decided to have him repeat second grade, hoping that another year would help him manage his symptoms and improve academically. However, Joshua's attention issues persisted, and the strategies used in the classroom were not tailored to his needs. As a result, he became frustrated and disengaged, leading to behavioral problems that compounded his academic struggles.

#### The Need for Inclusive Practices

These case studies illustrate the limitations and potential harms of repeating grades for students with special needs. Rather than providing a blanket solution, schools should focus on inclusive practices that address the unique needs of each student. This involves differentiated instruction, personalized learning plans, and a supportive learning environment that fosters growth and development for all students.
